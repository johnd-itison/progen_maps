Proceduarally Generated Maps
============================

This is a very simplistic ASCII map-drawing/generating code, with structure
derived from Jamis Buck's 'Mazes for Programmers'.

I'm using this as a testbed/framework for learning a bit about procedural
generation, and so I can try and remember when doing stuff with computers was
fun, and not an obligation that I do to pay my mortgage and keep my cat in
expensive food<sup id="catfood">[*](#catfoodfootnote)</sup>.

<a name="catfoodfootnote">*</a> If you have a long-haired cat like a Ragdoll, Royal Canin 'Hair and Skin Care' cat biscuits really do make a huge difference to their fur. Much, much easier to brush out and far less furballs. [â†©](#catfood)
